The Xenomorph University Portal simulates an academic information system with a strong focus on 
security, system integrity, and structured access. It integrates Role-Based Access Control to ensure that 
each user interacts only with modules appropriate to their assigned position. Students can manage their 
subjects, faculty can encode grades, registrars can manage records, and admins can oversee the 
system. Security components such as bcrypt password hashing, input validation, audit logging, and session 
expiration ensure that user data is protected and that system interactions remain accountable.
Additionally, the system implements RA 10173 and FERPA-aligned consent mechanisms, which 
emphasize user rights in data processing.
